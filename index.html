<p>My name is Siomani Drummond and I am a media artist based in New York City. As of right now, I am still trying to build my foundation as well as exploring the many possibilities that media production has to offer so I haven't discovered a single purpose or direction within the work that I want to create. I am looking forward to expanding and discovering that direction and a purpose that feels the most authentic to who I am and what I want to create and contribute to the world of media. I hope the course will guide me towards that direction helping me explore and find my purpose as an artist while challenging me to grow both in skill and in vision.</p>
