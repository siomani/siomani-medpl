<p>New York City-based filmmaker and media artist. Since August 2023, I have been an MFA Student in the Integrated Media Arts program at Hunter College. I currently work as a technical assistant and lab instructor for the Film & Media department of Hunter College. The tools I use the most are Premiere, After Effects, and Photoshop and more recently, I've been researching cross-modal synthesis and real-time translation between visual and auditory elements.</p>
