    <h2>Explanation</h2>
    <p>
      For this photomontage, I wanted to portray the concept of censorship and the limiting of freedom of speech. I really liked the phrase, "see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil" so I tried to tie it into my artwork. For my first layer I found a headshot of a girl and made it the main part of the image. Originally, I made a mask of her but I felt that it took away from the depth of the background so I left it as is. I first added the duct-tape over her eyes that was at first meant for her mouth. Then I came up with the idea of doing something different for the mouth instead of using the tape for both eyes and mouth. I made the mouth effect by using the smudge tool which took a couple of tries to get the smudging the way I liked but even then I had a few options. I didn't want to leave the other eye open so I also used the smudge tool on her eye to give a dug-out effect. Then I added the letters that help convey the message of the collage. After adding all these elements, it didn't feel quite finished yet so I decided to go along with the concept of a poster as the words gave it that feeling. I overlaid a paper texture over everything then adjusted the layers in the order I wanted it. I still feel like I can work on it more to make it more detailed. As I learn more techniques in PS I hope to come back and make it look the way I envision it.
