    <h2>Explanation</h2>
    <p>For this photomontage, I wanted to explore the concept of censorship and the restriction of freedom of speech. I was inspired by the phrase, "see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil," and aimed to incorporate its meaning into my artwork. For the first layer, I chose a headshot of a girl as the focal point of the piece. Initially, I created a mask of her but I felt it reduced the depth of the background so I decided to leave it unmasked. I began by placing duct tape over her eyes, which I had originally intended for her mouth. Then I decided to approach the mouth differently and used the smudge tool to create a distorted effect. It took several attempts to achieve the look I wanted, but I experimented with a few variations before settling on one. To maintain balance, I also used the smudge tool on her other eye to give it a dug-out or ripped out appearance.

Next, I added text elements that convey the message of the collage. Even after adding these components, the piece still didnâ€™t feel complete so decided to  lean into the poster-like effect that words give. I overlaid a paper texture across the image and adjusted the layers and opacity to achieve the desired composition. While I am satisfied with the overall concept, I feel there is still room to add more detail. As I continue to learn new techniques in Photoshop, I hope to revisit this piece and adjust it to the way I envision it.
