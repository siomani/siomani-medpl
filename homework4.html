    <h2>Explanation</h2>
    <p>For this photomontage, I wanted to portray the concept of censorship and the limiting of freedom of speech. I really liked the phrase, "see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil" so i tried to tie it into my artwork. For my first layer I found a headhsot of a girl and originally I made a mask of her but i felt that it took away from the depth of the background so I left it as is. Then i made the mouth effect by using the smudge tool </p>
