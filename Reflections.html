  <h2>Susan Sontag’s “Plato’s Cave”</h2>
<p>
  Personally, for me I use photography and image making to capture memories. I don't often stop to take photos as I like living in the moment, but when I do it signifies an important moment for me that I know I would want to look back at. So I take a picture to encapsulate not only the moment but the photo signifies for me how I felt in the moment. It's something I can always visit and reflect on. I usually like to take pictures on  my film camera which is obviously a still image. I really like the look of it visually, because it's not so crystal clear and bright like the newer phones and cameras today, the images come out a bit grainy and the lighting a bit more dim. It feels very nostalgic which also adds to the visual feeling of the moment through the photo. However, newer phone cameras today also have something called live photos that allow you so see a short “live image” with audio and although the feeling of the image is different from that of a film photo, or a digital camera photo, you're able to actually hear and see what was going on in the moment which can equally draw onto someone's emotions. As for graphics, I have not familiarized myself with that artform as yet. I think I would use graphics to enhance or create images into something new. I think I personally like things like collages and layering images so I'd lean more towards that creatively. At this moment in time, I feel that our world is represented heavily through media and images. Because of this, I think collage and layering images would be a strong way to represent visually, the current state of our world. Through collage, it can represent and capture the overwhelming and overstimulated feelings of the current essence of our world right now. What's captured in collage can vary from our daily lives, messages, different perspectives and narratives as well as current events, it would be a far different approach than just uploading a “simple” picture.  As a picture can only show limited information, it can also influence a different narrative than intended. I also feel like collage in a way, mirrors the fragmented ways in how we consume our media. Like scrolling, swiping and switching between different platforms rapidly which also in a way feels like switching between different realities. With these fragments, we piece them together to form our perceptions of the world which may not be the true reality of things. This art style can allow for contradiction and tension within just a single space. I feel adding words to an image, when done the right way can be really moving and make an image more meaningful. The words can either direct the interpretation of the image or provoke reflection by contrasting the difference in what we see and what we are told. It is not an art style I would mainly rely on however, it is something I'd like to include in my future works.

  <h2>Nesrine Malik’s “AI Slop”</h2>
  <p>The idea of “AI slop,” meaning low-quality content made with very little human input, really resonates with what I see happening in the current media environment. What bothers me most is how it slowly starts to distort our sense of reality. Lately, it seems like we are navigating two visual realities simultaneously. Where one consists of real photos and videos of life in actuality and the other made up of AI-generated images that appear everywhere.  In places like social media to private messages, ranging from whimsical cartoons and fantasy scenes to sexualized depictions of women and exaggerated political scenarios. What makes this content especially unsettling is how easily it spreads without being questioned. When AI-generated images or videos are shared through private platforms like WhatsApp, there is often no space to respond, comment, or challenge what is being shown. Because of this, the content becomes “imbued with the authority and reliability of the person who has sent it.” Personally receiving this content can feel believable because it might come from someone you know. This makes it even more powerful when the images match a person’s existing beliefs or political views. For example, the false content about the war in Sudan. AI doesn’t just create propaganda it makes it stronger by creating endless fake scenarios that aren’t limited by reality.
I also find it important to think about the values built into this content. As scholars have noted, “generative AI is structurally conservative, even nostalgic,” and I see this clearly in the kinds of images that circulate most widely. These systems often reproduce traditional ideas about race, gender, and family, while pushing aside more progressive representations. For example, white supremacy, authoritarian power, and rigid gender roles are often reframed as nostalgia for a simpler or more “natural” past. This shows up in the popularity of “trad wife” imagery or in AI-generated images of white, blond families shared by neofascist accounts as ideal models of society.The reason this flood of content continues is largely economic. Social media platforms benefit from content that is cheap to produce and highly engaging. Companies like Facebook do not treat AI slop as “junk,” but as “precisely what the company wants: highly engaging content.” From this perspective, content does not need to be accurate or meaningful as long as it keeps users scrolling. Algorithms are designed to “tickle human users into whatever feelings and passions keep them engaged,” even if that engagement comes from confusion, fear, or outrage.What worries me most is the emotional effect of living inside this constant stream of images. Serious issues are flattened, and real-world suffering is forced to compete with absurd or meaningless visuals. Over time, this creates numbness and visual overload. As we are pulled further into artificial and personalized media worlds, it becomes harder to stay grounded in shared reality. This leads to a “profound disorientation,” where everything feels “both too real and entirely unreal.” In the end, this environment encourages passivity, allowing the world to “sleepwalk into disaster,” not because people do not know what is happening, but because they are overwhelmed by how it is presented.

  <h2>Motherhood Stories</h2>
  <p>The interactive feature titled "Graphic Novel: Motherhood in crisis" focuses on the dangerous reality faced by women in Sierra Leone, where the maternal mortality rate is so high that "one in 10 women die during childbirth." This situation is made worse by "fragile" healthcare systems that have been pushed to the breaking point by crises like Ebola and COVID-19. As a result, many pregnant women are left without access to basic care and are forced to make "long and traumatic" journeys in search of treatment. The piece is presented as a "comic series" and follows four different stories of "hardship and survival," grounding a large-scale public health crisis in individual lived experiences.
The story that stood out to me most was “The distant patient: Birth in my village.” This narrative clearly shows how limited access to healthcare can have devastating consequences. I think the choice to tell this story through illustration is very intentional. Because the feature is framed as a "Graphic Novel" and a "comic series," illustration becomes central to how the story is communicated. The subject matter involves extreme vulnerability and the constant risk of death during pregnancy and childbirth. Using illustration creates a layer of distance that makes it possible to represent these experiences without exploiting the women involved. It allows the creators to visualize aspects of Memunatu’s experience that are otherwise difficult to capture, such as the emotional toll of a "long and traumatic" journey or the fear that comes with "risking death," while still respecting her privacy and dignity.
Illustration also helps translate a systemic failure into something more personal and accessible. Rather than presenting healthcare collapse as abstract data, the visuals show how that failure is felt in the body and in everyday life. The reader is not just told about poor infrastructure, but is invited to experience the consequences through Memunatu’s perspective.Visually, the illustrated sections of the interactive piece differ greatly from the photographs that are also included. Photographs serve an important role by grounding the story in real places and real people, making the crisis undeniable. They establish context and authenticity. The illustrations however, are more interpretive and stylized. This gives the artists freedom to represent internal emotions, movement, and the passage of time in ways that photography often cannot. 
Compared to using text alone, the illustrated format makes the story more engaging and easier to process. Complex issues like healthcare inequality and maternal mortality become more immediate when they are paired with visual storytelling. The emotional reality of "hardship and survival" and the fact that one in 10 women die during childbirth is communicated much more quickly and powerfully than it would be through text alone. Compared to a photography-only approach, illustration also helps preserve the privacy of the subjects. The stories deal with intimate moments of fear, pain, and medical crisis. Illustration allows the feature to convey the seriousness of these moments without showing graphic or invasive images of women in vulnerable situations. Overall, illustration provides the necessary distance to reflect on this human rights issue while still connecting the reader to the emotional truth of the women’s experiences.

  <h2>W. J. Hennigan, NY Times “The Rising Risk, and How We Stop It"</h2>
  <p>I find the recent analysis of the global nuclear threat deeply unsettling especially the conclusion that the risk of a nuclear strike may be higher now than at any point since the Cold War. One statement in particular stayed with me was that while nuclear war is often described as unimaginable, "it’s not imagined enough." Growing up, nuclear war has always been a distant historical concept that younger people feel disconnected from. However, today nuclear powers are expanding their arsenals and accelerating toward what many describe as a “new arms race” and it raises the question of how much public attention this threat is actually receiving.What really made the risk hit me was realizing that governments are already acting like a nuclear strike could happen at any moment. Seeing that a 2022 U.S. intelligence report gave a 50-50 chance of Russia using a nuclear weapon was shocking. It made the danger feel immediate and real, not some distant abstract threat. Learning that the Biden administration put together a “Tiger Team” to draft a new nuclear “playbook” showed me that this isn’t just speculation and that officials are preparing seriously. Ukraine’s own preparations, such as installing radiation detectors, stockpiling potassium iodide, and training medical workers, made the threat feel even more tangible. All of this made me pause and think about how fragile our sense of safety really is.
Imagining what could happen if deterrence failed is terrifying. I picture a city struck by a nuclear warhead and feel completely overwhelmed. Even if someone survived the initial blast, it would not mean they were safe. Radiation sickness, contaminated water, and long-term fallout would make life unbearable. Reading about “black-rain showers” and unburied bodies made me realize just how quickly life could be turned upside down and how little control ordinary people have over such a threat. What worries me even more is how many of the systems meant to prevent this kind of disaster are disappearing. The arms control agreements and nonproliferation efforts that helped stabilize the Cold War are now almost gone. Russia pulling out of the New START treaty, the last major agreement limiting U.S. and Russian nuclear weapons, makes the future feel increasingly unregulated. Losing this transparency weakens deterrence, which depends on a “carefully calibrated balance of terror.” Thinking about it, I see how precarious that balance really is. Past agreements, like the Limited Test Ban Treaty and SALT I, show that countries can cooperate even in crises, but today the lack of communication is alarming. Without it, the risk of rapid escalation and miscalculation only grows.
 The fact that the National and Nuclear Risk Reduction Center now receives far fewer messages than it once did makes the gap between nuclear powers feel even wider, and it makes me reflect on how quickly things could spiral out of control. The current nuclear buildup, driven by nine nuclear states and China’s rapid expansion in particular, really makes me think about how quickly the tools of war are moving compared to the tools of peace. Reading that even 100 Hiroshima-sized bombs could cause global famine and put 255 million people at risk of starvation made me realize that this is not just a political issue. It is a matter of human survival, and it forced me to reflect on how urgent it is to prevent nuclear escalation before it is too late.
