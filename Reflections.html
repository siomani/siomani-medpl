  Personally, for me I use photography and image making to capture memories. I don't often stop to take photos as I like living in the moment, but when I do it signifies an important moment for me that I know I would want to look back at. So I take a picture to encapsulate not only the moment but the photo signifies for me how I felt in the moment. It's something I can always visit and reflect on. I usually like to take pictures on  my film camera which is obviously a still image. I really like the look of it visually, because it's not so crystal clear and bright like the newer phones and cameras today, the images come out a bit grainy and the lighting a bit more dim. It feels very nostalgic which also adds to the visual feeling of the moment through the photo. However, newer phone cameras today also have something called live photos that allow you so see a short “live image” with audio and although the feeling of the image is different from that of a film photo, or a digital camera photo, you're able to actually hear and see what was going on in the moment which can equally draw onto someone's emotions. As for graphics, I have not familiarized myself with that artform as yet. I think I would use graphics to enhance or create images into something new. I think I personally like things like collages and layering images so I'd lean more towards that creatively. At this moment in time, I feel that our world is represented heavily through media and images. Because of this, I think collage and layering images would be a strong way to represent visually, the current state of our world. Through collage, it can represent and capture the overwhelming and overstimulated feelings of the current essence of our world right now. What's captured in collage can vary from our daily lives, messages, different perspectives and narratives as well as current events, it would be a far different approach than just uploading a “simple” picture.  As a picture can only show limited information, it can also influence a different narrative than intended. I also feel like collage in a way, mirrors the fragmented ways in how we consume our media. Like scrolling, swiping and switching between different platforms rapidly which also in a way feels like switching between different realities. With these fragments, we piece them together to form our perceptions of the world which may not be the true reality of things. This art style can allow for contradiction and tension within just a single space. I feel adding words to an image, when done the right way can be really moving and make an image more meaningful. The words can either direct the interpretation of the image or provoke reflection by contrasting the difference in what we see and what we are told. It is not an art style I would mainly rely on however, it is something I'd like to include in my future works.
