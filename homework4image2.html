    <h2>Explanation</h2>
    <p>For this photomontage, I wanted to explore the issue of overconsumption. Although I initially planned to address multiple forms of overconsumption, I ultimately focused on fast fashion and the excessive consumption of clothing. For the first two layers, I used bubble wrap and cardboard as a base, then built the rest of the composition on top. I chose not to alter the colors too much because I wanted to maintain a messy, chaotic look kind of like a pile of trash. Aside from masking the layers, the most challenging part was deciding how to arrange the images and figuring out their placement. Essentially how they interacted through shape and what should overlap. Finally, I added the quote “Buy less, choose well, make it last” over the plastic bag, since that area felt empty without it, and I felt the text tied in the overall message of the piece. Looking forward, I’d like to develop this work further by adjusting the layout, adding more images,or possibly expanding the canvas.
